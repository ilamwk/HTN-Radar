Dataset Description
===================
r1, r2 refer to Receiver 1 and Receiver 2, respectively.

'vary' and 'const': the drone was strapped stationary to a stand
while the blades were spun at their idle speed (const) and when they
were given varying amounts of acceleration (vary).

The distance X meters is the actual distance i.e. measured using a tape
measure.
