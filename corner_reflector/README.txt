These dataset are those of a corner reflector which was designed to have
an effective RCS=1m2 for this frequency of radar (5.8GHz). 
The corner reflector is a stationary target located a set distance from
the radar. A picture of the reflector is provided in this folder.

The table below provides the range bin where the target is detected
and the actual distance target is from the radar.
Note 'range bin with target' was obtained from only Receiver 1 data.

The suffix at the end of the filename (r1 , r2) indicates
(receiver 1, receiver 2).
